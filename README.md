Project Name: Flow Shop Scheduling using Random Search, NEH, and Genetic Algorithm for a Car Manufacturer

Description: Computation of the "Makespan" for flow-shop scheduling problems using Random Search, NEH and Genetic Algorithm (GA); 
Comparison of the performance of 3 algorithms on different car data sets; Experimentation on GA to recommend optimal parameters 
(population size, p_crossover, p_mutation, threshold).
